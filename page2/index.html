                This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: Some languages are so 
                constructed—English among them—that we each only really speak one sentence 
                in our lifetime. That sentence begins with your first words, toddling around 
                the kitchen, and ends with your last words right before you step into the 
                limousine, or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant vaguely on hand. 
                Or, if you are blessed, they are heard by someone who knows you and loves 
                you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.

                When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, he said: “That’s a lot of semicolons!” 
                he is absolutely right; 
                </p>
                <p class='para-two'>
                    the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble the novel 
                    of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon (which, by the way, is the least-used 
                    mark of punctuation in all of poetry)
                </p>
                <p class='para-three'>
                    you should stop and be thankful that there exists 
                    this little thing, invented by a human being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows
                     us to go on and keep on connecting speech that for all apparent purposes is unrelated.

                You might say a poem is a semicolon, a living semicolon, what connects the first line to
                 the last, the act of keeping together that whose nature is to fly apart. Between the 
                 first and last lines there exists—a poem—and if it were not for the poem that intervenes,
                  the first and last lines of a poem would not speak to each other.
                Would not speak to each other. Because the lines of a poem are speaking to each other,
                 not you to them or they to you.  I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie 
                 and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: The End. I miss 
                 finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last
                 words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling The End.

                It was its own thrill. I didn’t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a 
                deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, 
                and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the book.
