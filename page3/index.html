                I have never, in my life, read a poem that ended with the words The End. Why is that,
                 I wonder. I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel 
                 that there has been no great sustention of energy, no marathon worthy of pulling
                  tape across the finish line. And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully
                   written by hand in the sixth grade, and at the bottom of the page, in India ink,
                    beautifully apart from the rest of the text, were the words The End. And I 
                    realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great 
                    achievement for them to have written anything, and they are completely unaware 
                    of the number of stories and poems that have already been written; they know
                     some, of course, but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not
                      the only persons residing on the planet. And so they sign their poems and 
                      stories like kings. Which is a wonderful thing.

                Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: the ending
                 will have the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a 
                 pirouette, do something unexpectedly incongruent. Gaston Bachelard says the single most 
                 succinct and astonishing thing: We begin in admiration and we end by organizing our
                  disappointment. The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, 
                  vital and fresh—it could also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the 
                  onset of disappointment and its dignification; the least we can do is dignify our
                   knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization, by admiring not 
                   the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it.

                I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try  <a href="https://samarthbhatia33.github.io/storytelling/page4/" target="_blank" class="inevitable">inevitable</a> thing. And if you 
                believe that, then you are conceding that in the beginning was the act, not the word.
                The painter Cy Twombly quotes John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The image cannot 
                be disposed of a primordial freshness which ideas can never claim.”

                Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some of his 
                drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante.

                Many men and women have written long essays and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work.

                Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: origins (beginnings) have consequences (endings).
                The poem is the consequence of its origins.
