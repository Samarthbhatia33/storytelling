                Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this: 
                “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or 
                states of tension seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most 
                gratifying ones are those in which whatever tensions are created are also released.
                 Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience is gratifying to the extent 
                 that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”

                But there is no book I know of on the subject of how poems begin. How can the origin
                 be traced when there is no form or shape that precedes it to trace? It is exactly
                  like tracing the moment of the big bang—we can go back to a nanosecond before the 
                  beginning, before the universe burst into being, but we can’t go back to the precise 
                  beginning because that would precede knowledge, and we can’t “know” anything before 
                  “knowing” itself was born.

                I have flipped through books, reading hundreds of opening and closing lines, across 
                ages, across cultures, across aesthetic schools, and I have discovered that first 
                lines are remarkably similar, even repeated, and that last lines are remarkably 
                similar, even repeated. Of course in all cases they remain remarkably distinct, 
                because the words belong to completely different poems. And i began to realize, 
                reading these first and last lines, that there are not only the first and last 
                lines of the lifelong sentence we each speak but also the first and last lines 
                of the long piece of language delivered to use by others, by those we listen to.
                 And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same:
                  in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of 
                  language that we hear as children repeated night after night, like a refrain: I 
                  love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now. And I encountered 
                  words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth: 
                  I love you. I am here with you. Don’t be afraid. Go to sleep now.

                But it is growing damp and I must go in. Memory’s fog is rising. Among Emily Dickinson’s 
                last words (in a letter). A woman whom everyone thought of as shut-in, homebound, cloistered,
                 spoke as if she had been out, exploring the earth, her whole life, and it was finally time 
                 to go in. And it was.
